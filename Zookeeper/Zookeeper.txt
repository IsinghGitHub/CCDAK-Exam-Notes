ZooKeeper servers will be deployed on multiple nodes. This is called an ensemble. An ensemble is a set of 2n + 1 ZooKeeper servers where n is any number greater than 0. The odd number of servers allows ZooKeeper to perform majority elections for leadership. At any given time, there can be up to n failed servers in an ensemble and the ZooKeeper cluster will keep quorum. If at any time, quorum is lost, the ZooKeeper cluster will go down.

Zookeeper cluster to withstand loss of 2 server, require total of 2*2+1 = 5 servers.

In Zookeeper multi-node configuration, initLimit and syncLimit are used to govern how long following ZooKeeper servers can take to initialize with the current leader and how long they can be out of sync with the leader. If tickTime=2000, initLimit=5 and syncLimit=2 then a follower can take (tickTimeinitLimit) = 10000ms to initialize and may be out of sync for up to (tickTimesyncLimit) = 4000ms

In Zookeeper multi-node configuration, The server.* properties set the ensemble membership. The format is

server.<myid>=<hostname>:<leaderport>:<electionport>, where:

myid is the server identification number.

In this example, there are three servers, so each one will have a different myid with values 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The myid is set by creating a file named myid in the dataDir that contains a single integer in human readable ASCII text. This value must match one of the myid values from the configuration file. If another ensemble member has already been started with a conflicting myid value, an error will be thrown upon startup.
leaderport is used by followers to connect to the active leader. This port should be open between all ZooKeeper ensemble members.
electionport is used to perform leader elections between ensemble members. This port should be open between all ZooKeeper ensemble members.
