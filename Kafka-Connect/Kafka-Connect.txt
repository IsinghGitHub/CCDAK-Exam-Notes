Kafka Guarantees
Messages are appended to a topic-partition in the order they are sent
Consumer read the messages in the order stored in topic-partition
With a replication factor of N, producers and consumers can tolerate upto N-1 brokers being down
As long as number of partitions remains constant for a topic ( no new partition), the same key will always go to same partition

Client Bi-Directional Compatibility
an Older client (1.1) can talk to Newer broker (2.0)
a Newer client (2.0) can talk to Older broker (1.1)
